Mastermind Game Room: Multiplayer Networked Game

Project Overview:
This project extends the Mastermind board game by adding multiplayer and networking capabilities using Java Socket Programming. The application supports multiple clients, each attempting to guess a server-generated code, with one client winning per round. The server handles communication and game logic, while clients submit guesses and receive personalized feedback until a winner is declared.

Key Features:

Java Socket Programming: Implements networking capabilities for server-client communication using Java sockets.
Multiplayer Game Room: Allows multiple clients to play against the serverâ€™s single code in each round. The first client to guess correctly wins, prompting a new game.
Server and Client Applications: The server manages game logic and message dispatch, while each client operates independently, receiving feedback specific to its guesses.

Skills Demonstrated:

Experience with Java sockets to handle concurrent client connections and server communication.
Designed with OOP principles, maintaining clear separation between client and server functionalities.
Utilized Java libraries and handled multiple players, providing dynamic feedback based on individual game states.
